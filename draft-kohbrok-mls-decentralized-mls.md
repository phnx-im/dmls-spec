--- abstract

Messaging Layer Security provides strong end-to-end security guarantees for
group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security
(PCS). However, MLS requires a Delivery Service (DS) to facilitate agreement
between group members on the order of Commit messages. In decentralized settings
the only way to implement a functional DS is to require group members to retain
key material so they can process commits out-of-order. Retaining key material
this way is in violation of the MLS deletion schedule and significantly reduces
the FS of the protocol. This draft specifies Decentralized MLS, based on the the
Fork-Resilient Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK proposed by Alwen
et al. {{FRCGKA}}. In essence, DMLS extends MLS such that key material can be
retained to process Commits out-of-order with minimal losses to FS, thus
allowing safer deployment in decentralized environments.

# Introduction

TODO: Introduction

Open Questions:
- Why do removed members need to receive their commit confirmation from their
  removers? They should be able to process the removing commit without the init
  secret in the first place.
- Is it safe to use the commit secret regularly in the key schedule _and_ to
  derive the commit confirmation or do we need an additional derivation step to
  ensure domain separation?
- Why would we need to generate a fresh signature key pair with each update?
- Do we need an additional membership tag?

# Epoch identifiers

In MLS, each epoch is identified by a 64 bit unsigned integer, with the epoch
increasing by one with each commit. The integer identifies epochs uniquely as
long as there is only one chain of Commits. However, in a decentralized context
there can be conflicting commits. For example, if two group member send a commit
at the same time with different subsets of group members receiving a different
commit first. After processing the newly arrived Commit, all group members would
be in the same epoch, but in different group states. For subsequently arriving
messages, it is unclear from the integer designating the epoch, which state the
message belongs to. In such scenarios it is important that epochs are uniquely
identifiable.

When using DMLS, epochs are represented as byte strings of length `KDF.Nh` (thus
depending on the group's ciphersuite). The byte string identifying an epoch is
derived from the epoch's `epoch_secret` and can thus be learned when creating or
processing the commit that initiates that epoch.

```pseudocode
epoch = DeriveSecret(epoch_secret, "epoch")
```

# DMLS key schedule

DMLS conceptually modifies the MLS key schedule by enabling the creation of
multiple `init_secret`s, where each init secret can be used to initialize a
subsequent epoch.

The individual `init_secret`s are derived through a puncturable pseudorandom
function (PPRF, {{puncturable-pseudorandom-function}}) keyed by the
`base_init_secret`.

# Puncturable pseudorandom function

A PPRF allows the derivation of keys in a forward secure way. In particular, a
PRF that was evaluated with a given key and input can't be evaluated with those
same parameters again. Storing the original input key thus doesn't harm the
forward secrecy of (deleted) output keys.

The MLS Secret Tree as defined in {{!RFC9420}} already represents a PPRF an
needs to be modified only slightly for the purpose of this document.

In the context of MLS, the Secret Tree has as many leaves as the group has
members. To derive child init secrets, the same tree is used but with `KDF.Nh`
leaves.

The function `DeriveFSSecret(secret, input)` thus follows these steps:

- Check if `secret` and `input` are of length `KDF.Nh`
- With `secret` as the root node secret and `input` as the leaf index, derive
  the direct path nodes and the copath nodes as defined in Section 9 of
  {{!RFC9420}}
- With `leaf_node_secret` as the resulting secret compute the final output using
  `DeriveSecret(leaf_node_secret, "pprf")`
