--- abstract

Messaging Layer Security (MLS) provides strong end-to-end security guarantees
for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security
(PCS). MLS requires a Delivery Service (DS) component to facilitate agreement
between group members on the order of Commit messages. In decentralized settings
without an authoritative entity to enforce ordering, group members will likely
have to retain key material so they can process commits out-of-order.

Retaining key material, however, significantly reduces the FS of the protocol.
This draft specifies Decentralized MLS (DMLS), based on the the Fork-Resilient
Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK proposed by Alwen et al.
{{FRCGKA}}. In essence, DMLS extends MLS such that key material can be retained
to process Commits out-of-order with recuded impact to FS, thus allowing safer
deployment in decentralized environments.

# Introduction

...

DMLS allows group members to keep around old group state a little more safely,
because the init secret of old epoch states is punctured. However, keeping an
old epoch state around is still not as safe as deleting it in the first place.
See {{security-considerations}} for more details.

While DMLS is thus safer to use in scenarios where members must be able to
process old commits, it is still not as safe as the use of vanilla MLS with its
strict deletion schedule.

Even when using DMLS, applications should take care that group state forks are
short-lived and group members (and/or assisting servers) endeavour to resolve
forks as soon as possible.

In contrast scenarios should be avoided where multiple forks are long-lived. For
example, if two or more parts of a group are not in contact with one-another and
effectively run their own fork of the same group.

# Epoch identifiers

In MLS, each epoch is identified by a 64 bit unsigned integer, with the epoch
increasing by one with each commit. The integer identifies epochs uniquely as
long as there is only one chain of Commits. However, in a decentralized context
there can be multiple commits for the same epoch, which means that an integer is
not sufficient to uniquely identify an epoch. For example, if two group member
send a commit at the same time with different subsets of group members receiving
a different commit first. After processing the newly arrived Commit, all group
members would be in the same epoch, but in different group states. For
subsequently arriving messages, it is unclear from the integer designating the
epoch, which state the message belongs to. In such scenarios it is important
that epochs are uniquely identifiable.

The `dmls_epoch` can be used for this purpose.

```pseudocode
dmls_epoch = DeriveSecret(epoch_secret, "epoch")
```

A dmls_epoch is represented by byte strings of length `KDF.Nh` (thus depending
on the group's ciphersuite). The byte string identifying an epoch is derived
from the epoch's `epoch_secret`.

# DMLS Messages

As regular MLSMessages only contain integer-based epoch identifiers, this
section introduces DMLSMessages, a simple wrapper that adds a dmls_epoch header
to an MLSMessage.

~~~ tls
struct {
  MLSMessage message;
  opaque dmls_epoch<V>;
} DMLSMessage
~~~

# DMLS key schedule

DMLS uses a modified version of the MLS key schedule that allows the derivation
of multiple `init_secret`s, where each init secret can be used to initialize a
subsequent epoch.

The individual `init_secret`s are derived through a puncturable pseudorandom
function (PPRF, see {{puncturable-pseudorandom-function}}) keyed by the
`base_init_secret`.

# Puncturable pseudorandom function

A PPRF allows the derivation of keys in a forward secure way. In particular, a
PRF that was evaluated with a given key and input can't be evaluated with those
same parameters again. Storing the original input key thus doesn't harm the
forward secrecy of (deleted) output keys.

The MLS Secret Tree as defined in {{!RFC9420}} already represents a PPRF an
needs to be modified only slightly for the purpose of this document.

In the context of MLS, the Secret Tree has as many leaves as the group has
members. To derive child init secrets, the same tree is used but with `KDF.Nh`
leaves.

The function `DeriveFSSecret(secret, input)` thus follows these steps:

- Check if `secret` and `input` are of length `KDF.Nh`
- With `secret` as the root node secret and `input` as the leaf index, derive
  the direct path nodes and the copath nodes as defined in Section 9 of
  {{!RFC9420}}
- With `leaf_node_secret` as the resulting secret compute the final output using
  `DeriveSecret(leaf_node_secret, "pprf")`

# State management

As outlined in {{security-considerations}} DMLS makes it safer to retain old MLS
group states. As such, it enables an _eventually consistent_ delivery service as
described in Section 5.2.2. of {{!RFC9750}}, i.e. one that tolerates out-of-order
delivery of messages. This in turn allows the use of DMLS in applications with
highly decentralized architectures.

The lack of a strong agreement on message order, however, leads to the various
state-agreement problems inherent to distributed systems and independent of
(D)MLS.

More concretely, applications need to specify the following.

- What fork should a client choose when sending a message?
- When can an old epoch state be safely deleted?
- When can a fork be safely consolidated and deleted?
- How should two forks be consolidated?

The answers to these questions depend on the application's specific architecture
and other requirements and are thus outside of the scope of this document.

The remainder of this section shows an example of how these questions can be
answered in a decentralized scenario.

## Example: Federated scenario with server support

The architecture of the first application consists of a federation of servers,
where each server serves one or more clients.

The servers can queue messages for their clients and determine the order of
handshake messages for the groups their clients are in.

In this system, forks can only occur if a subset of servers lose connectivity
from the rest.

### Server behaviour

The exact nature of the algorithm used by the servers to agree on a commit for
the next epoch is out of scope for this example. However, the requirement of
such an algorithm are:

- Agreement: If one or more commits reach one or more servers at the same time
  the algorithm should facilitate agreement between the servers that can
  currently reach one-another.
- Netsplit detection: Servers should be able to detect if the federation of
  servers has split. If connections between individual servers fail, other
  servers can act as forwarding proxies between the disconnected servers.

If a netsplit is detected, servers will fack back on agreement within their
subgroup of servers. Agreed-upon commits and other group messages are buffered
for later fan-out to the rest of the federation.

If a netsplit ends, all messages buffered during the netsplit are delivered to
their respective destinations.

If a fork has occurred during the netsplit, the fork with the lexicographically
higher confirmation tag in the first differing commit wins and the servers
restart their agreement algorithm with respect to that fork.

If there was another netsplit during a netsplit, the same rules apply.

When fanning out group messages to their clients, servers include a flag to
indicate whether the old commit state should be retained due to an ongoing
netsplit.

### Client behaviour

Clients generally only have one fork of a given group. If they send a message,
that's the fork they choose.

Epoch states are generally deleted immediately after processing the next commit,
except when the server indicates that the epoch state should be retained.

When a client receives a commit for an old epoch (i.e. if a fork occurs), it
retains the fork where the first differing commit has the lexicographically
higher confirmation tag.

To keep the scenario simple, losing forks are simply deleted.

# Security Considerations

The use of a PPRF to derive init secrets for new epochs significantly improves
forward secrecy in scenarios where clients need to be able to process multiple
commits for a given epoch.

However, PPRF only improves forward secrecy for the init secret. Group members
must still delay the deletion of other secrets such as the (private) decryption
keys for the nodes in the ratchet tree. This delay in deletion compromises the
forward secrecy of the protocol. Conversely, the fact that other group members
might encrypt to those keys in turn weakens the protocol's post-compromise
security.

It is thus still advisable to delete old epoch states as soon as the functional
requirements of the application allows it.

A rule that will be safe for most applications, for example, is that an old
epoch state can be deleted once each group member has sent a commit on at least
one fork "upstream" of that epoch state. This signals that all group members
have agreed to continue using this particular fork of the group state.

For effective forward secrecy and post-compromise security it is thus advisable
to choose a state management algorithm where members converge on a shared fork
rather than continuously using different forks of the same group.
